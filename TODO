- README

- tests for invalid behavior
- tests for consistent die return strings

- Verify on 32-bit machine
- Verify on BE machine

- POD documentation

- Export

- XS code.  Really we want to either a speedup of vec routines,
  basically like Scalar::Vec::Util to add big-endian help, or
  go all out and write something that makes a SV string with all
  our methods supported.

- Also see SWF::BinStream.  It has a few similarities, but lots
  of differences.


CODE:

- POD documentation

- m > 2 Fibonacci codes

- Ternary Comma

- Fenwick punctured codes

- Goldbach and Ulam additive codes.  Probably not efficient
  for anything large.

- Thoughts on Huffman, arithmetic
